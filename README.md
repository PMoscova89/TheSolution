# LeetCode Practice Playground 🚀

## Objective

This repository is a comprehensive, hands-on playground for practicing classic LeetCode and coding interview problems in Swift.  
Each problem comes with:
- **Mock data** for easy testing
- A `BlankSolution` class (with step-by-step, beginner-friendly comments)
- A `Solution` class with my own working implementations (serves as the answer key)

**If you’re learning, teaching, or just want to see clean, commented code solutions—this repo is for you.**

---

## Motivation

My main reason for creating this repo is twofold:

1. **Help Others:**  
   I wanted a resource where anyone (beginner, student, or interviewer)can not only see working code, but also practice writing their own, using the `BlankSolution` class. This makes it easier to build real understanding and confidence.

2. **"Patrick was here."**  
   I also wanted to leave my mark. If you stumbled onto my GitHub out of curiosity (or maybe while prepping for an interview, or snooping around before hiring me), I want you to see at a glance:  
   - I know how to break down problems  
   - I care about code clarity and maintainability  
   - I put in the work  
   
   It’s a bit of my way of saying, “Yeah, I was here, and I can do this.”

## How to Use

- Start by browsing the problems and mock data.
- Practice filling out the `BlankSolution` class first (the comments guide you step-by-step).
- When you’re ready, check your answer against the `Solution` class.
- Rinse and repeat for as many problems as you want!
- (More problems on the way. If I got it wrong during a stressful technical interview. I put it here)
